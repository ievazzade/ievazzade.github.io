I have joined University of Nebraska-Lincoln as a postdoctoral research associate in 2019, after recieving my PhD at Solid State Physics from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. My research at UNL is focused on the correlation between stability and activity in catalysis and designing durable, highly-active water splitting electrocatalysts for sustaibanle production of hydrogen for energy applications.
